# Audio-Equalizer
We use MATLAB to realize a audio equalizer, which can mainly change the music style and also has some other functions  
There are two apps, App1 is based on the sheet music（谱子）. And the music is generated througn our processings.
* In the first interface, the user can choose the instrument as he like. 
* In the second interface, user can change the music style, like pop, jazz, etc. He or she can also see the waveform in both time domain and frequency domain. The before and after comparison can be easily seen.

App2 has similar functions to App1, a difference lies in that App2 is based on reading .wav file. So user can choose any music wav file as he like. We've also realized functions like vocal cancellation, speed change, tonal modification.
